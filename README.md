## Potential Improvements:

- Handling of synonyms and abbreviations to increase matching accuracy.
- Implementation of weighting and scoring system to rank matches.
- Integration of machine learning algorithms to continuously improve matching accuracy.
- Incorporation of semantic analysis to match contextually similar data.
- Development of efficient algorithms to handle large datasets in real-time.

## Open Questions:

- What is the best approach to handle missing or incomplete data in matching?
- How to balance the trade-off between precision and recall in fuzzy matching?
- How to effectively handle different levels of matching granularity?
